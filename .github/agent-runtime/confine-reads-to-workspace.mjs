// PreToolUse hook: confine the built-in Read / Grep / Glob tools to the job's
// workspace ($GITHUB_WORKSPACE).
//
// Why a hook, not an --allowedTools scope: `--allowedTools` accumulates onto the
// action's base Read/Glob/Grep grant, and an allow entry only pre-approves a
// call — it cannot revoke the base grant, so `Read(./**)` does NOT confine these
// tools. Only a deny decides a call. A PreToolUse hook sees the resolved path
// and denies anything outside the workspace, so a runner file (/etc/*,
// /proc/self/environ, ~/.config/*) cannot be read and funnelled to a public
// comment.
//
// Paths are resolved with POSIX rules. These jobs run on Linux; using the
// platform path module would make the same input depend on the machine running
// the contract test.
//
// A lexical check alone is not enough: the checkout is untrusted, and a symlink
// inside it passes a string comparison while the kernel follows it out of the
// tree on open. So a path that passes is also resolved on disk, and the real
// path must pass the same containment test.
//
// Contract: stdin is the PreToolUse hook JSON. Print a deny decision as JSON on
// stdout to refuse an out-of-tree read; print nothing (exit 0) to let the normal
// permission flow proceed. A hook error is not a deny, so malformed input that we
// cannot judge is allowed through rather than exiting non-zero — except a missing
// workspace, or a path that exists but cannot be resolved, where we fail closed.
